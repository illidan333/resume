Interview Driven Development mindset: every day, before you start your work, ask yourself one question, if i get fired today, what should I do today at work to make my resume look better.

The web app will link your work (Slack, Jira, Documentation, code, database, video etc) to an AI model to try to create a competitive resume along with all the talking points you need to prepare to dig deep on projects/skills on your resume.

Example use case: I would like to modify our Kubernetes config files today to convert a few stand alone docker container into Kubernetes pods in order to make the resource usage a bit more efficient. the system can modify the resume to include such an achievement with metrics improved and details on how the job was done.
